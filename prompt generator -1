general_prompt_structure = """Be creative and unique and Creating an effective general prompt structure involves several steps that help to ensure clarity and conciseness. It should be tailored to the specific idea, but here's a general template you can adapt for most situations:

1. **Define the Idea/Concept (Introduction):**
    - Provide a succinct, high-level overview of the idea/concept you're about to explain.
    - Give any necessary background information or context.

2. **Describe the Objective (Purpose):**
    - Clearly outline what you are trying to achieve with the idea/concept.
    - Discuss any key benefits or outcomes that you expect.

3. **Break Down the Key Elements (Body):**
    - Divide the main idea into its constituent parts.
    - For each element, provide a clear definition and a detailed explanation.
    - Give examples to illustrate each element, if applicable.

4. **Discuss Implementation/Execution (Process):**
    - Explain how you would put the idea/concept into practice.
    - Discuss any challenges you might encounter and how you plan to overcome them.
    - Describe the resources, tools, or skills that you would need.

5. **Summarize and Highlight Key Takeaways (Conclusion):**
    - Sum up the main points of the idea/concept.
    - Highlight the most important aspects and the value they add.

6. **Potential Improvements/Next Steps (Future Scope):**
    - Suggest how the idea/concept could be improved or expanded in the future.
    - Discuss any next steps you plan to take or recommend.

This is a general structure, and it can be adapted depending on the nature of the idea/concept you're discussing. For instance, if you're explaining a scientific theory, you might replace the "Implementation/Execution" section with a discussion of the supporting evidence. Remember to use clear, straightforward language and to structure your points in a logical order to ensure that your prompt is as effective as possible."""
